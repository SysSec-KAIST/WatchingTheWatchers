# How to use

## Environment Setup

You need to prepare at least one labtop, one cellphone, and one Linux server.


### Labtop Setup

Set up Innowireless DM tool on a labtop
and connect a cellphone used to collect data.
Most of the Python scripts will be run on this labtop.


### Linux Server Setup

Set up airscope on a Linux server.
We use airscope to capture radio signals in the same way as an adversary.

Additionally, please copy `send_mail.py` to the Linux Server and install `smtpd`
on the server. This script will be run to notify you when experiments are
completed via email.

TODO: Add description sudo setup for `mv` and `kill`


### Configuration
Many configuration variables depend on your experimental environment.
Please see [config.py](config.py) and modify the variables appropriately.
